# DriveRecorderExtensions

In my job, I have to deal a lot with automotive drive recorders - especially with the ETAS ES720.
Basically, the ES720 is something like a car PC running an embedded Windows on it and ETAS INCA for data acquisition.

To achieve the best results for my work, there are some features missing and to get the minimum "idea to working feature" time, I am currently working on some of these extensions for my personal needs.

Therefore, in this repository I want to manage any self developed hard- and software extensions for ETAS drive recorders - maybe some of them are usefull for anybody, too.

**I am currently working on:**

**Software Extensions:**
- updating drive recorer configurations using USB flash drives
- Wizzard-Tool to create new configurations for the drive recorder

**Hardware Extensions:**
- low cost switch for remote starting

**Planned extensions:**
- low cost solution for status reports in clear text (something like an LCD screen showing the current status of the drive recorder)
- memory storage for measurement data using a network attached storage (NAS)


**Note: This is not an official ETAS accound nor ETAS product or so. There is no support and warranty and guarantee that any of this is working. Any of these extensions can be used on anybody's own risk.**
